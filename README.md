# Hello World! I'm Amy Oulton âœ¨

I'm a web and iOS developer living in beautiful BC. Like most millennials, I fell in love with computers growing up and started my development journey editing my own Neopets themes with some good old HTML. Now, I have a passion for turning beautiful designs into well-written code. Whether I'm working in the frontend, on the web, or creating a beautiful app in iOS, I bring passion to whatever it is I'm creating.
